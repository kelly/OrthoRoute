OrthoRoute is a GPU-accelerated PCB autorouter plugin for KiCad, designed to handle massive circuit boards that would be impractical to route by hand. Born out of necessity to route a backplane with 17,600 pads, OrthoRoute leverages CUDA cores to parallelize the most computationally intensive parts of PCB routing.

## Key Features

- GPU-Accelerated Routing: Uses CUDA/CuPy for wavefront expansion algorithms
- Manhattan Routing: Specialized for orthogonal routing patterns (horizontal/vertical layer pairs)
- KiCad Integration: Built as a native KiCad plugin using the IPC API
- Real-time Visualization: Interactive 2D board view with zoom, pan, and layer controls
- Multi-layer Support: Handles complex multi-layer PCB designs

## Why GPU Acceleration?

Traditional autorouters like FreeRouting can take hours or even days on large boards. OrthoRoute uses GPUs for the embarrassingly parallel parts of routing - specifically Lee's wavefront expansion algorithm - while handling constraints and decision-making on the CPU.

For Manhattan routing patterns (the plugin's specialty), this approach is particularly effective because:

- Traces follow predictable orthogonal patterns
- Each layer has a dedicated direction (horizontal or vertical)
- Geometric constraints make the problem highly parallelizable

## Performance

While general autorouting remains a complex constraint-satisfaction problem, OrthoRoute excels at:

- Large backplanes with regular connector patterns
- Manhattan-style routing requirements
- Boards where traditional autorouters would take prohibitively long

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **KiCad 9.0+** with IPC API support
- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyQt6**
- **kipy** (KiCad IPC client)

### Installation

1. **Download**: Get the latest release or clone the repository
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run**: Start OrthoRoute with your KiCad project open
   ```bash
   cd src
   python orthoroute_plugin.py
   ```

### Usage

1. **Open your PCB** in KiCad
2. **Launch OrthoRoute** - it will automatically connect via IPC
3. **Route your nets** using the enhanced autorouter
4. **Visualize results** with the interactive PCB viewer
