OrthoRoute is a PCB autorouter plugin for KiCad with GPU acceleration. Designed to handle massive circuit boards that would be impractical to route by hand, OrthoRoute leverages modern software engineering practices, CUDA cores, and sophisticated routing algorithms to deliver production-ready autorouting solutions.

Born out of necessity to route a backplane with 17,600 pads, OrthoRoute represents 10,000+ lines of carefully architected code following domain-driven design principles.

A comprehensive explanation of the _why_ and _how_ of this repository is available on the [build log for this project](https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/OrthoRoute.html).

## 🏗️ Architecture

OrthoRoute is built using **hexagonal architecture** (ports & adapters) with **domain-driven design** principles:

### Core Architecture Layers
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic for PCB routing concepts (Board, Net, Route, Component)
- **Application Layer**: Orchestration services and use cases with CQRS pattern
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Adapters for KiCad APIs, GPU providers, and persistence
- **Presentation Layer**: PyQt6 GUI and KiCad plugin interfaces

### Key Design Patterns
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dependency inversion
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for scalable operations  
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable routing algorithms (Lee's, Manhattan, A*, GPU-accelerated)
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data persistence and retrieval
- **Domain Events**: Reactive architecture for real-time updates

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 **Performance & Scalability**
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA/CuPy parallelization with CPU fallback
- **Memory Management**: Smart memory pooling and garbage collection
- **Batch Processing**: Route thousands of nets efficiently
- **Multi-threaded**: Parallel processing where beneficial

### 🎯 **Routing Algorithms**
- **Lee's Wavefront**: Traditional guaranteed-path algorithm with GPU acceleration  
- **Manhattan Router**: Specialized for orthogonal routing patterns
- **A* Pathfinding**: Heuristic-guided routing for optimal paths
- **GPU Manhattan**: Massively parallel Manhattan routing

### 🔌 **KiCad Integration**
- **IPC API**: Real-time board data synchronization
- **Native Plugin**: Seamless integration into KiCad workflow

### 🎨 **Professional GUI**
- **Rich Visualization**: Authentic KiCad color schemes and rendering
- **Interactive Controls**: Algorithm selection, display options, layer management
- **Real-time Updates**: Live board visualization with zoom/pan
- **Three-panel Layout**: Controls, PCB viewer, and routing information

### 🏭 **Enterprise Features**
- **DRC Integration**: Design rule checking and validation
- **Layer Management**: Multi-layer PCB support with direction awareness
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time routing progress and statistics
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and graceful degradation

## 🎯 Why GPU Acceleration?

Traditional autorouters can take hours or days on large boards. OrthoRoute uses GPUs for embarrassingly parallel routing operations while handling constraints and decision-making on the CPU.

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Lee's Algorithm**: Parallel wavefront expansion across thousands of CUDA cores
- **Manhattan Routing**: Simultaneous routing of multiple orthogonal nets  
- **Memory Bandwidth**: Fast GPU memory for large routing grids
- **Batch Operations**: Process entire netlist in parallel

## 🔧 Development

### Architecture Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Business logic independent of frameworks
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level details  
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

### Adding New Routing Algorithms

```python
# Implement the RoutingEngine interface
class CustomRoutingEngine(RoutingEngine):
    def route_net(self, net: Net, board: Board) -> List[Route]:
        # Your algorithm implementation
        pass
        
# Register with factory
routing_factory.register_engine("custom", CustomRoutingEngine)
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/

# Run integration tests  
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Performance benchmarks
python -m pytest tests/performance/
