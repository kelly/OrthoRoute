       1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  Iteration

CAPACITY=1 (STRICT):
- Best: 4,041 @ iter 10
- Pattern: Initial descent, then GROWING oscillation/divergence
- Via violations: 7 segments (minimal)
- Horizontal overuse: 99.9% of problem

CAPACITY=2 (BALANCED):
- Best: 1,911 @ iter 8  (53% BETTER than capacity=1)
- Pattern: Steady convergence with DAMPING oscillation
- Via violations: Slightly higher but acceptable
- Horizontal overuse: More evenly distributed

KEY INSIGHT:
Stricter via capacity (1) does NOT improve overall convergence.
It reduces via flexibility → forces longer routes → increases horizontal congestion.

The real bottleneck is HORIZONTAL TRACK CAPACITY (Layer 30: 16.5% of overuse),
NOT via segments (only 0.1% of overuse).

VERDICT: segment_capacity=2 is the optimal setting.
