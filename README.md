### Architecture Overview
```
OrthoRoute Core Architecture:
orthoroute_plugin.py → KiCadInterface → OrthoRouteWindow → PCBViewer + Routing

Key Components:
├── src/orthoroute_plugin.py      # 🎯 MAIN ENTRY POINT (run this!)
├── src/orthoroute_window.py      # GUI components (not standalone)
├── src/kicad_interface.py        # KiCad IPC API integration
├── src/routing_engines/          # Modular routing algorithms
│   ├── base_router.py           # Abstract router interface  
│   └── lees_router.py          # GPU-accelerated Lee's algorithm
├── src/autorouter_factory.py    # Algorithm selection factory
└── src/thermal_relief_loader.py # Free Routing Space generation
```

**Critical**: Always run `python src/orthoroute_plugin.py` - this is the only entry point!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **KiCad 9.0+** with IPC API enabled
- **Python 3.8+** 
- **PyQt6**
- **NVIDIA GPU** (optional but recommended for best performance)
- **CuPy** (for GPU acceleration)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bbenchoff/OrthoRoute.git
   cd OrthoRoute
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Enable KiCad IPC API** (if not already enabled)

4. **Open your PCB in KiCad**

5. **Run OrthoRoute** (CRITICAL - use this exact command):
   ```bash
   python src/orthoroute_plugin.py
   ```

### Usage Workflow

1. **📋 Load Board**: OrthoRoute automatically connects to KiCad via IPC
2. **⚡ Route Nets**: Click "Re-route" to run the GPU-accelerated autorouter  
3. **👀 Visualize**: Interactive PCB viewer shows routing results in real-time
4. **✅ Apply**: Use "Apply to KiCad" to commit routes to your PCB
5. **🎯 Iterate**: Re-route individual nets or clear all routes as needed

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### GPU-Accelerated Lee's Algorithm
- **Wavefront Expansion**: CUDA-accelerated pathfinding with 8-connected neighbors
- **Binary Dilation**: Efficient GPU-based wave propagation using CuPy
- **Smart Backtracing**: Minimal GPU-CPU transfers for optimal path reconstruction
- **Timeout Management**: Multi-strategy routing with fallback mechanisms

### Free Routing Space Architecture  
- **Virtual Copper Pour**: DRC-compliant obstacle detection using KiCad's copper pour algorithm
- **Clearance Zones**: Automatic trace-to-pad spacing based on netclass rules
- **Obstacle Grids**: Boolean matrices representing routable vs blocked areas
- **Layer Management**: Separate obstacle grids for front and back copper layers

### Performance Optimization
- **Pre-computed Pad Exclusions**: O(N×P) → O(P) complexity reduction 
- **Cached Grid System**: Startup computation eliminates per-net processing bottleneck
- **Bitwise Operations**: GPU-optimized Boolean operations for obstacle combination
- **Path Optimization**: Grid-cell paths reduced to minimal waypoint segments

### Algorithm Selection
```python
from routing_engines.autorouter_factory import create_autorouter, RoutingAlgorithm

# Create Lee's algorithm router with GPU acceleration
autorouter = create_autorouter(
    board_interface=board_interface,
    drc_rules=drc_rules, 
    gpu_manager=gpu_manager,
    grid_config=grid_config,
    algorithm=RoutingAlgorithm.LEE_WAVEFRONT
)

# Route all nets with performance monitoring
result = autorouter.route_all_nets(timeout_per_net=10.0)
```

## 📊 Performance Results

### Latest Benchmark (Production Test)

### Key Performance Factors
- **Pre-computed Optimization**: Eliminated O(N×P) pad processing bottleneck
- **GPU Acceleration**: NVIDIA RTX 5080 with full CUDA utilization  
- **Free Routing Space**: DRC-compliant pathfinding without constraint violations

### Before vs After Architecture
```
BEFORE (O(N×P) bottleneck):
For each net: Process ALL pads → Timeout after 7.1% success

AFTER (O(P) optimization):  
Startup: Pre-compute ALL pad exclusions
For each net: Copy cached grid + clear current net's pads → 96.4% success
```
